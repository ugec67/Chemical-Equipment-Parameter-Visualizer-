# 🔬 Chemical Equipment Parameter Visualizer  
### Hybrid Web + Desktop Application

This project is developed as part of an **Intern Screening Task**.  
It is a **hybrid application** that works both as a **Web Application** and a **Desktop Application**, focused on **data visualization and analytics for chemical equipment**.
---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Chemical Equipment Parameter Visualizer** allows users to upload a CSV file containing chemical equipment data such as:

- Equipment Name  
- Equipment Type  
- Flowrate  
- Pressure  
- Temperature  

The **Django backend** processes the uploaded data, performs analytics using **Pandas**, and exposes summary statistics through REST APIs.

Both:
- **React (Web Frontend)** and  
- **PyQt5 (Desktop Application)**  

consume the same backend APIs to display **tables, charts, and summaries**.
---

## 🧠 System Architecture

A single backend ensures consistent data processing and analytics across both the web and desktop platforms.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|------|------------|
| Backend | Python, Django, Django REST Framework |
| Web Frontend | React.js, Chart.js |
| Desktop Frontend | PyQt5, Matplotlib |
| Data Processing | Pandas |
| Database | SQLite (stores last 5 uploads) |
| Version Control | Git & GitHub |
